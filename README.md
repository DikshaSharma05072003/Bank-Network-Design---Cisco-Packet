# Bank-Network-Design---Cisco-Packet-Tracer

For my computer networks project, I simulated a bank network design connecting devices across four branches, including access points, wireless printers, laptops, switches, routers, and PCs. I configured intra-VLANs and inter-VLANs, implemented static and dynamic routing approaches, and created multiple subnets to ensure efficient traffic management and communication across the network.
